When the dependencies of a go project ($project in the following lines)
are changing:

- the go.mod and go.sum files in $project.git are updated
- in tor-browser-build, run `make go_vendor-$project-alpha` or
  `make go_vendor-$project-nightly`
- find the new file created in directory `out/$project/go_vendor` and
  compute its sha256sum
- in `projects/$project/config`, update `norec/sha256sum` for `go_vendor`
  in `input_files`.
