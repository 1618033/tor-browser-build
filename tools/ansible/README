This directory contains some ansible script that we use to setup some
machines that we use for Tor Browser development.

To deploy some changes you need the ansible package to be installed on
your machine, and be able to log in with ssh as root on the machine(s)
where the changes need to be deployed.

You can then use one of the following makefile targets:

ansible-tbb-build:
  Deploy changes to the machine used by Tor Browser team members to do
  some Tor Browser builds.

fpcentral:
  Deploy fpcentral to forrestii.torproject.org. To be able to run this
  you need to be in the fpcentral tpo ldap group. Your ldap password will
  be asked, to sudo to the fpcentral user.

boklm-tbb-nightly-build:
  This target is used by boklm to deploy a nightly build machine. If
  anybody else wants to set up their own nightly builds, it is possible to
  do it by adding a new host to the inventory file and making copies of
  group_vars/boklm-tbb-nightly/ and boklm-tbb-nightly-build.yml.
