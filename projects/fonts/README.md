This project creates a collection of fonts to include with each desktop
platform as Firefox bundled fonts.

We standardize the font configuration to minimize the entropy measurable through
fonts. So, we distribute many fonts to try to cover as many languages as
possible and discourage users from modifying our default configuration.

A lot of information on how we selected the founds to include can be found in
[tor-browser#30589](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/30589).

This directory contains two readme files: `README.md` (this file) and
`README.txt`. The former is for the source tree, the latter is shipped with the
browser, to explain to users why they should not change the files there.
